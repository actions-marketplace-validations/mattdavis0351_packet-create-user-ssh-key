# GitHub Actions for creating user SSH keys on Packet.com

## Automate your access

This GitHub Action will store a new user level SSH key on [packet.com](https://packet.com). SSH keys grant you access to resources such as deployed servers within a project.

# Creating projects

With this action you can automate your workflow by adding user level SSH keys using the [packet.com api](https://api.packet.net).

To use this action you will first need an [authentication token](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/authentication/) which can be generated through the [Packet Portal](https://app.packet.net/login?redirect=%2F%3F__woopraid%3DjUPDKi0tqtym).

You will also need a public/private key pair. [Learn how to generate keys](https://www.packet.com/developers/docs/servers/key-features/ssh-keys/).

**NEVER share your private key with anyone!**

**Packet.com is NOT a free service, so you will be asked to provide billing information. This action will NOT have access to that information.**
